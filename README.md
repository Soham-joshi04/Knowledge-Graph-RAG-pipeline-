# Knowledge-Graph-RAG-pipeline-
In this project we made a efficient knowledge graph making pipeline. Also devised a basic RAG pipeline to on top of this knowledge graph.

Run the python scripts 1 to 6 in order. Indexes will get formed in indexes folder. Have you domain knowledge in input folder, in multiple text file format. After sequentially running python scripts 1 to 6 run app.py or query.py to interact with your data using custom RAG pipeline.

Note: inspiration for making vanilla knowledge graph in neo4j data base is taken from "From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization" by Microsoft
